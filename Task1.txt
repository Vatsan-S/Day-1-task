What is HTTP?
It is one of the pillar inTim Berners-Lee's world wide web, among four. It is a standardised protocol, built to transfer data between networked devices.

Versions of HTTP:

1.HTTP/0.9 - The one line protocol
2.HTTP/1.0
3.HTTP/1.1 - The standardized protocol
4.HTTP/2(After google's SPDY)


HTTP/1.1

A more standardized protocol which is parellely created while version 1.0 was in use. Major updates were, reusable connections(Keep-alive), pipelining - which parellely allows second request before the response of the previous request reducing the latency, and cross origin resource sharing and more.

HTTP/2.0

after 15 years of successfull running, HTTP/1.1 was succeeded by HTTP/2.o introduced for greater performance.

Major difference between these two are:

1. Even 6 TCP connections are not enough in mordern times, so it introduces stream method, where requests are created as multiple streams, which is easier.
2. Headers cannot be compressed in HTTP1.1, but 2.o solved it by seperating header data and request data.
