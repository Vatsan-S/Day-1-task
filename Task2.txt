What are objects?

Objects are an advanced data type, where you can store complex data structures in a structured way.

Example of how a datatype looks.

We can create an empty object by the following syntax.
var objectName = new Object();

Values in an object is stored as Key - Value pairs. Where key is called properties or methods. In simple terms properties are the values associated with the object.

Examples 

myBike.make = 'Enfield';
(Here myCar is the object name, make is the property and suzuki is the value)

myBike.model = 'Classic350';

myBike.year = 2016;

myBike.bhp =20.2;


To access the object and its properties, we can use the following syntax.

myBike.year

Output: 2016

Another way of accessing the data is by bracket notations

myBike[year]

Output: 2016

Most important factor is- object and properties are case sensitive.

We use the following syntax to create or append a property inside an object
ObjectName.ObjectProperty = propertyValue;

Different ways of creating an object are

Syntax 1:
let bike = {name: 'Diavel', maker:'Ducati', engine:'1262'};

Syntax 2:(With constructor)
function Vehicle(name, maker) {
   this.name = name;
   this.maker = maker;
}
let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
console.log(car1.name);    
console.log(car2.name);
